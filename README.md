# RecogLib

Recoglib is a library that lets you recognize and categorize a stream of pictures for specific document types.

 

## Migration

Take a look at the [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) file



## Document types

Recoglib is capable of recognizing types that include:

- Identity card
- Driving license
- Passport
- Gun license
- Residency permit
- European Health Insurance Card
- Holograms
- Selfie (human face picture)
- Face liveness
- EU VISA

 

## Configuration management

For compilation, running and deployment of the application following tools are required. Newer versions of the tools should work, these were tested to work and used during the development:

- Hardware:
  - iOS device with camera for testing
  - macOS device for development
- Software (required for development and deployment):
  - macOS
  - Xcode 15
- Minimal supported iOS version:
  - iOS 13.0

 

## Installation

### Statically link the frameworks

Link your project against `RecogLib.xcframework` and `LibZenid.xcframework` frameworks. Frameworks are located in [Sources](https://github.com/ZenIDTeam/ZenID-ios/tree/master/Sources) directory. )

- Hardware:
    - iOS real device with camera for testing (simulator doesn't support the camera)
    - macBook for development
- Software (required for development and deployment):
    - Xcode

### Installation with SPM

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Add remote package dependency https://github.com/ZenIDTeam/ZenID-ios.git
3. In your app target, General tab add **LibZenid_iOS** and **Recoglib_iOS** frameworks 

 

## Authorization

The SDK has to be authorized, otherwise it is not going to work. 

1. Contact your manager and get information of initSDK API Endpoint and access to the ZenID system where you have to set your bundle ids. The api key you receive must be inserted into the request using the Cookie header

```swift
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
configuration.timeoutIntervalForRequest = 600
configuration.timeoutIntervalForResource = 600

if let cookie = HTTPCookie(properties: [
    HTTPCookiePropertyKey.name : "api_key",
    HTTPCookiePropertyKey.value : _YOUR_API_KEY_,
    HTTPCookiePropertyKey.originURL : apiURL,
    HTTPCookiePropertyKey.path : apiURL.path
]) {

    configuration.httpCookieStorage?.setCookie(cookie)

}
```

2. Fetch your challenge token from SDK:

```swift
import RecogLib_iOS

let challengeToken = ZenidSecurity.getChallengeToken()
```

3. Send the `challengeToken` to the initSDK API endpoint.

```swift
GET https://{''your-api-url''}/initSdk?token={challengeToken}

Response:

{
  "Response": "......."
}
```

4. Use response token, returned from initSDK API Endpoint, to initialize the SDK:

```swift
let responseToken = ... // backend response - initSDK API Endpoint
let success = ZenidSecurity.authorize(responseToken: responseToken)
```

 

5. Do not forget to check returned value of `authorize(responseToken:)` method. If it is true, the SDK has been successfully initialised and is ready to be used, otherwise response token is not valid.

 

## Models

You can choose which models (documents (CZ, SK, ...), selfie, faceliveness) you want to support.
You can find all models available in the [Models](https://github.com/ZenIDTeam/ZenID-ios/tree/master/Models) folder in the root of this repository.

If you want to support Selfie, add/link this folder and all files included: [Models/face](https://github.com/ZenIDTeam/ZenID-ios/tree/master/Models/face) into your Xcode project.

If you want to support Faceliveness, add/link this folder and all files included: [Models/face](https://github.com/ZenIDTeam/ZenID-ios/tree/master/Models/face) into your Xcode project.

If you want to support Documents, such as ID, Passport and so on, or different countries, follow instructions below:

1. You can find all models for documents grouped by countries in the [Models/documents](https://github.com/ZenIDTeam/ZenID-ios/tree/master/Models/documents) folder.
2. Choose which countries do you want to support.
3. Optionally, you can remove unnecessary files in those folders, such as `GUN` files if you do not want to scan/recognize these kinds of documents.
4. Link/add all selected folders with your Xcode project.



## Usage

The SDK provides two options how to handle the scanning process. First of them is lightweight, where everything is provided to you and you can have running code with the logic and UI in just a couple lines of code. Second of them is more complicated where you have to implement everything from the scratch by yourself if needed. Let's have a look at those options. 



## Select profile

The `SelectProfile` method allows you to set the frontend validator configuration on the backend. The SDK receives a list of profiles and their respective configurations when Init() is called. Calling `SelectProfile()` sets the profile to be used for subsequent use of the verifier.

```swift
let profileSelected = ZenidSecurity.selectProfile(name: profileName)

let profileSelected = ZenidSecurity.selectProfile(name: ""). // default profile
let profileSelected = ZenidSecurity.selectProfile(name: "NFC"). // select profile named NFC (defined on backed)

```

## List countries and documents enabled by licence

If your use case requires the user to select which document to validate then you can ask the backend what
countries, documents and document pages are supported.

```swift
// Get supported countries
let country = ZenidSecurity.supportedCountries()
// Get supported documents for the country
let documents = ZenidSecurity.supportedDocuments(for: country)
// Get supported pages for the document and country
let pages = ZenidSecurity.supportedDocumentPageCodes(for: country, documentRole: documentRole)

```

## Usage - Lightweight



### DocumentController

Use `DocumentController` for scanning documents. You can configure the behaviour and also build custom UI based on the delegate of the controller if needed or you can just use our built-in UI that is provided. 

```swift
// Configuration
let documentControllerConfig = DocumentControllerConfiguration(
    showVisualisation: true,
    showHelperVisualisation: true, // Enables text information rendering
    showDebugVisualisation: false, // Enables debug visualisation rendered directly to camera feed
    dataType: .picture,
    role: .Idc,
    country: .Cz,
    page: .Front,
    code: nil,
    documents: nil,
    settings: nil
)

// Controller
let camera = Camera()
Let cameraView = CameraView()
let urlPathOfModels =  URL.modelsDocuments
let urlPathOfMrzModels = URL.mrzModels // models used for reading MRZ zone from document

let documentController = DocumentController(camera: camera, view: cameraView, modelsUrl: urlPathOfModels, mrzModelsUrl: urlPathOfMrzModels)
documentController.delegate = self


// configure and start reading
documentController.configure(configuration: documentControllerConfig)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should always keep one instance of `Camera`, even when you have more controllers (such as SelfieController, FacelivenessController, DocumentController).

Add the `CameraView` into your view hierarchy in order to see the camera's UI and live feed.

You can pass role, country, page, and code if you want to scan only one document. If you need to scan more than one document use `documents` field to pass an array of allowed documents.

You can turn off all visualisations by setting the `showVisualisation: false`. After that you are free to build your own UI. 

The delegate of the controller is following:

```swift
public protocol DocumentControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func controller(_ controller: DocumentController, didScan result: DocumentResult, nfcCode: String)
    func controller(_ controller: DocumentController, didScan result: DocumentResult)
    func controller(_ controller: DocumentController, didRecord videoURL: URL)
    func controller(_ controller: DocumentController, didUpdate result: DocumentResult)
}
```

You can implement the delegate to be able to receive a message when scanning was successful or when the state of the scan has been changed.
The `didUpdate` method could be used for building your custom UI. The method is called every single time when there is an update of the state of scanning process.



#### NFC

The SDK allows you to read NFC data from supported documents. NFC support must be configured on the backend, the mrz models must be loaded and the `SelectProfile("NFC")` method must be called on the SDK side.

The delegate method named `func controller(_ controller: DocumentController, didScan result: DocumentResult, nfcCode: String)` is called if the MRZ zone is successfully scanned and decoded on the document.

At this point you must start and finish reading the NFC document.  The `NfcDocumentReader` class is used for this purpose.  Due to the variability of the customer UI, the SDK does not provide a ready-made UIViewController solution to completely handle all NFC chip reading states. However, you can take inspiration from the `ReadNfcViewController` file in our demo application.

The result of calling the `processNfcResult` method is the same `DocumentResult` object as in the case of normal document verification. The next step is to send the captured and signed image to the backend.



```swift
func controller(_ controller: DocumentController, didScan result: DocumentResult, nfcCode: String) {
   Task {
      let nfcReader = NfcDocumentReader(mrzKey: nfcCode)
      let nfcData:NfcData = try await nfcReader.read()
      let documentResult = documentController?.processNfcResult(nfcData: nfcData, status: .OK)
   }
}
```



### FacelivenessController

Use `FacelivenessController` for scanning face. You can configure the behaviour and also build custom UI based on the delegate of the controller if needed or you can just use our built-in UI that is provided. 

```swift
// Configuration
let faceLivenessControllerConfig = FacelivenessControllerConfiguration(
    showVisualisation: true,
    showHelperVisualisation: true,
    showDebugVisualisation: false,
    dataType: .picture,
    isLegacy: false
)
// Controller
let camera = Camera()
Let cameraView = CameraView()
let urlPathOfModels = URL.modelsFolder.appendingPathComponent("face")
let facelivenessController = FacelivenessController(camera: camera, view: contentView, modelsUrl: urlPathOfModels)
facelivenessController.delegate = self
facelivenessController.configure(configuration: faceLivenessControllerConfig)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should always keep one instance of `Camera`, even when you have more controllers (such as SelfieController, FacelivenessController, DocumentController).

Add the `CameraView` into your view hierarchy in order to see the camera's UI and live feed.

You can turn off all visualisations by setting the `showVisualisation: false`. After that you are free to build your own UI. 

The delegate of the controller is following:

```swift
public protocol FacelivenessControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func controller(_ controller: FacelivenessController, didScan result: FaceLivenessResult)
    func controller(_ controller: FacelivenessController, didRecord videoURL: URL)
    func controller(_ controller: FacelivenessController, didUpdate result: FaceLivenessResult)
}
```

You can implement the delegate to be able to receive a message when scanning was successful or when the state of the scan has been changed.
The `didUpdate` method could be used for building your custom UI. The method is called every single time when there is an update of the state of scanning process.

### SelfieController

Use `SelfieController` for scanning face. You can configure the behaviour and also build custom UI based on the delegate of the controller if needed or you can just use our built-in UI that is provided. 

```swift
// Configuration
let selfieControllerConfig = SelfieControllerConfiguration(
    showVisualisation: true,
    showHelperVisualisation: true,
    showDebugVisualisation: false,
    dataType: .picture
)
// Controller
let camera = Camera()
Let cameraView = CameraView()
let selfieController = SelfieController(camera: camera, view: contentView, modelsUrl: URL.modelsFolder.appendingPathComponent("face"))
selfieController.delegate = self
selfieController.configure(configuration: selfieControllerConfig)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should always keep one instance of `Camera`, even when you have more controllers (such as SelfieController, FacelivenessController, DocumentController).

Add the `CameraView` into your view hierarchy in order to see the camera's UI and live feed.

You can turn off all visualisations by setting the `showVisualisation: false`. After that you are free to build your own UI. 

The delegate of the controller is following:

```swift
public protocol SelfieControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func controller(_ controller: SelfieController, didScan result: SelfieResult)
    func controller(_ controller: SelfieController, didRecord videoURL: URL)
    func controller(_ controller: SelfieController, didUpdate result: SelfieResult)
}
```

You can implement the delegate to be able to receive a message when scanning was successful or when the state of the scan has been changed.
The `didUpdate` method could be used for building your custom UI. The method is called every single time when there is an update of the state of scanning process.

## Usage - From Scratch

You are free to implement everything from the scratch, without use our controller classes. The SDK provides three classes for you: `DocumentVerifier`, `SelfierVerifier`, and `FacelivenessVerifier`.

### `DocumentVerifier`

Recoglib comes with `DocumentVerifier` that makes scanning documents really easy to use.

#### Initialization

##### Verifier settings

You can tune a couple of parameters of document verifier. Each initializer has optional `settings` parameter.

```swift
let settings = DocumentVerifierSettings(
    showAimingCircle: false,
    drawOutline: true,
)
```

| parameter name                  | default value | range          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| showAimingCircle                | true          | Bool           |
| drawOutline                     | false         | Bool           |

```swift
let verifier = DocumentVerifier(role: .Idc, country: .Cz, page: .Front, language: .Language, settings: settings)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Properties `role`, `country`,  `page` , an `language` are public and can be changed whenever you like.

##### 1. Recognizing only one specific document

First you initialize `DocumentVerifier` with expected role, country, page and language. For example, Front side of Czech Identity card looks like this.

```Swift
let verifier = DocumentVerifier(role: .Idc, country: .Cz, page: .Front, language: .Language)
```

##### 2. Recognizing multiple predefined documents

Alternativally you can initialize `DocumentVerifier` with `DocumentsInput` that needs array of `Document` structures.  `Document` structure is a structure that consists of `role: DocumentRole`, `country: Country`, `page: PageCode`, and `DocumentCode`.

For example, if you want to scan Front side of Czech Identity card and Front side of Slovak driving license the setup looks like this.

```swift
let documentsInput = DocumentsInput(documents: [
    Document(role: .Idc, country: .Cz, page: .Front, code: nil),
    Document(role: .Drv, country: .Sk, page: .Front, code: nil)
])
let verifier = DocumentVerifier(input: documentsInput, language: .Czech)
```

##### 3. Recognizing multiple undefined documents.

The parameters of `DocumentVerifier` initializer are optional, you can always pass nil value. 
For example, if you want to scan all documents available, just pass nil to every parameter.

```swift
let verifier = DocumentVerifier(role: nil, country: nil, page: nil, language: .Language)
```

For example, if you want to scan all Czech documents available, just pass nil to every parameter except `country`, that will be `Czech`.

```swift
let verifier = DocumentVerifier(role: nil, country: .Cz, page: nil, language: .Language)
```

#### Models

You have to load models that you would like to support. `URL` is the path to your folder that contains files or other folders, such as CZ, SK, etc. You have to pass url that is a folder, not a single file. 

```swift
let urlOfFolderWithModels = Bundle.main.bundleURL.appendingPathComponent("Models/documents")
if let models = DocumentVerifierModels(url: urlOfFolderWithModels) {
    verifier.loadModels(models)
}
```

#### Image processing

##### Prerequirements - Camera session

Request Camera Permission

Open your project's `Info.plist` file and add the following key:

- `NSCameraUsageDescription`: A message explaining why you need access to the camera.

Create an instance of `AVCaptureSession` and `AVCaptureVideoDataOutput`. These will allow you to capture video frames from the camera.
Define the `func captureOutput(_: ,didOutput: ,from:)` delegate method declared in `AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate` and call the `verify(buffer: )` method of `DocumentVerifier`. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note this delegate method **is called from background thread**. If you desire to update your view from this method, you **need** to do so from the main thread as shown below.
> 
> It is important to set the correct device orientation and send correctly oriented images for verification

> [!NOTE]
> More complex `AVCaptureSession` setup can be found in our examples
> [PureVerifierViewController.swift](./ZenIDDemo/Controller/PureVerifierViewController.swift) or [PureSelfieVerifierViewController](./ZenIDDemo/Controller/PureSelfieVerifierViewController.swift)

| Property Name                   | Default   | Range              |
|---------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| specularAcceptableScore         | 50        | <0; 100>           |
| documentBlurAcceptableScore     | 50        | <0; 100>           |
| showAimingCircle                | True      |                    |
| drawOutline                     | False     |                    |
| readBarcode                     | True      |                    |


Each initializer has optional `settings` parameter.
```swift
import AVFoundation

class CameraViewController: UIViewController, AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {

    private let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()
    private let videoDataOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()
    private(set) var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setupCamera()

        // ! Note that set proper orientation is important
        setOrientation(orientation: UIDevice.current.orientation)
    }

    // Function to set up the camera
    private func setupCamera() {
        guard let captureDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else {
            fatalError("Camera not available.")
        }

        do {
            let input = try AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: captureDevice)
            if captureSession.canAddInput(input) {
                captureSession.addInput(input)
            }

            if captureSession.canAddOutput(videoDataOutput) {
                captureSession.addOutput(videoDataOutput)
                videoDataOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "videoQueue"))
            }

            let previewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: captureSession)
            previewLayer.videoGravity = .resizeAspectFill
            self.previewLayer = previewLayer

            captureSession.startRunning()
        } catch {
            print("Error setting up camera: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }

    // AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate methods
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        // Process each video frame here

        let result = verifier.verify(buffer: sampleBuffer)

        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // update your view here
        }
    }

    func setOrientation(orientation: UIDeviceOrientation) {
        for connection in captureSession.connections {
            switch UIDevice.current.orientation {
            case .portrait:
                previewLayer?.connection?.videoOrientation = .portrait
                connection.videoOrientation = .portrait
            case .landscapeRight:
                previewLayer?.connection?.videoOrientation = .portrait
                connection.videoOrientation = .landscapeLeft
            case .landscapeLeft:
                previewLayer?.connection?.videoOrientation = .portrait
                connection.videoOrientation = .landscapeRight
            case .portraitUpsideDown:
                previewLayer?.connection?.videoOrientation = .portrait
                connection.videoOrientation = .portraitUpsideDown
            default:
                break
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively you can use the `verifyImage(imageBuffer: )` with CVImageBuffer of media data as shown below.

```swift
extension ViewController: AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        let pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer)
        let result = verifier.verifyImage(imageBuffer: pixelBuffer)
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.updateView(with: result)
        }
    }
}
```



#### NFC

If the validation state of `DocumentVerifierState` is `.Nfc`, it should start reading NFC data from the document.

```swift
Task {
   let nfcCode = verifier.getNfcKey()
   let nfcReader = NfcDocumentReader(mrzKey: nfcCode)
   do {
      let nfcData = try await nfcReader.read()
      let jsonString = nfcData.encodeToJson()
      
      verifier.processNfc(jsonData: jsonString, status: .OK)

   } catch {
    
   }
}
```



The `processNfc` method must be called even if the NFC data reading from the document fails. For example, if the user cancels the read. 

```swift
Task {
   let nfcCode = verifier.getNfcKey()
   let nfcReader = NfcDocumentReader(mrzKey: nfcCode)
   do {
      let nfcData = try await nfcReader.read()
   } catch {
      verifier.processNfc(jsonData: "", status: .USER_SKIPPED)    
   }
}
```

#### Draw renderables

In case you want to add an information layer with objects that the verifier has detected, you can use the `verifier.getRenderCommands(canvasWidth:Int, canvasHeight:Int)` method. This method returns a string representation of the detected objects. This string is converted into a collection of drawable objects implementing `Renderable` protocol using `RenderableFactory.createRenderables(commands: String)`.
The types of renderable objects are the classes `Line`,`Rectangle`,`Circle`,`Ellipse`,`Text`,`Triangle`.

```swift
var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
var drawingLayer = DrawingLayer()

// Add the custom layers
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    if let previewLayer {
        view.layer.addSublayer(previewLayer)
        previewLayer.frame = view.frame
    }

    view.layer.addSublayer(drawingLayer)
    drawingLayer.frame = view.frame
}

// Get the objects detected in the current frame and render them over the preview layer.
private func drawRenderables(buffer: CMSampleBuffer) {
    guard let size = previewLayer?.frame.size, let commands = verifier.getRenderCommands(canvasWidth: Int(size.width), canvasHeight: Int(size.height))
    else { return }

    DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
        let renderables = RenderableFactory.createRenderables(commands: commands)
        self?.drawingLayer.setRenderables(renderables)
    }
}
```

## Face liveness verifier

You can use  `FaceLivenessVerifier` to verify face liveness from short video. Human faces are to be identified in video frames.
Interface is very similar to  `DocumentVerifier`, first you initialize `FaceLivenessVerifier` and then call the `verify(buffer: )` or `verifyImage(imageBuffer: )` method in `func captureOutput(_: ,didOutput: ,from:)` .

##### Face liveness step parameters

> Available since version 2.0.12

During the face liveness check, additional parameters (`FaceLivenessStepParameters`) for the current check can be accessed by calling the verifier method `getStepParameters()`
The object is only available during the liveness part of the process. It is null during the preliminary quality check.

Sample:

```Swift
let verifierResult = verifier.verifyImage(imageBuffer: pixelBuffer)
let parameters:FaceLivenessStepParameters = verifier.getStepParameters()
```

The object `FaceLivenessStepParameters` has the following properties:
| Property         | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name             | Name of the step. It can be `CenteredCheck`, `AngleCheck Left`, `AngleCheck Right`, `AngleCheck Up`, `AngleCheck Down`, `LegacyAngleCheck`, or `SmileCheck`. CenteredCheck requires the user to look at the camera. The AngleCheck steps require the user to turn their head in a specific direction. The LegacyAngleCheck requires the user to turn his head in any direction. It's only used when legacy mode is enabled. SmileCheck requires the user to smile. |
| totalCheckCount  | The total number of the checks the user has to pass, including the ones that were already passed. |
| passedCheckCount | The number of checks the user has passed.                    |
| hasFailed        | Flag that is true if the user has failed the most recent check. After the failed check, a few seconds pass and the check process is restarted - the flag is set to false and passedCheckCount goes back to 0. |
| headYaw          | Euler angles of the head in degrees. Only defined if a face is visible. |
| headPitch        | Euler angles of the head in degrees. Only defined if a face is visible. |
| headRoll         | Euler angles of the head in degrees. Only defined if a face is visible. |
| faceCenterX      | Coordinates of the center of the face in relative units. Multiply by the width or height of the camera preview to get absolute units. Only defined if a face is visible. |
| faceCenterY      | Coordinates of the center of the face in relative units. Multiply by the width or height of the camera preview to get absolute units. Only defined if a face is visible. |
| faceWidth        | Size of the face in relative units. Multiply by the width or height of the camera preview to get absolute units. Only defined if a face is visible. |
| faceHeight       | Size of the face in relative units. Multiply by the width or height of the camera preview to get absolute units. Only defined if a face is visible. |

#### Models

You have to load models that you would like to support.
URL is the path to a specific file. You have to pass url that is a specific single file, not a folder. 

```Swift
let verifier = FaceLivenessVerifier(...)
let url = Bundle.main.bundleURL.appendingPathComponent("Models/face")
if let models = FaceVerifierModels(url: url) {
    verifier.loadModels(models)
}
```

### Holograms

You can use  `DocumentVerifier` to detect 2D holograms on cards.
To do that, you can use this object the same way like to detect documents and call method `beginHologramVerification` and endHologramVerification. You can record video for selfie and faceliveness, however, there is no need to call any methods on their verifiers.

Detection logic in `captureOutput(_: ,didOutput: ,from:)` is almost the same but in case of holograms you can easily add reconrding video with `VideoWriter` class.
This video can be uploaded to the backend after successful detection of hologram.

### Selfie verifier

You can use  `SelfieVerifier` to verify selfie (human face picture) from short video. Human faces are to be identified in video frames.
Interface is very similar to  `DocumentVerifier`, first you initialize `SelfieVerifier` and then call the `verify(buffer: )` or `verifyImage(imageBuffer: )` method in `func captureOutput(_: ,didOutput: ,from:)`.

#### Auxiliary Images

You can get all images that have been taken during the Faceliveness process.

```Swift
let verifier = FaceLivenessVerifier(...)
let info = verifier.getAuxiliaryInfo()
for imageData in info.images {
    let image = UIImage(data: imageData)
    // You can use the image
}
for metadata in info.metadata {
    // You can use the image metadata
}
```

#### Legacy mode

Faceliveness verifier has two modes. First is the new one and second one is the legacy. You can choose which one you want by using FaceLivenessVerifierSettings in constructor or `update` method of the verifier class. Moreover, you can specify the qualify of those pictures. Be default the legacy mode is disabled.

Constructor method

```Swift
let settings = FaceLivenessVerifierSettings(
    isLegacyModeEnabled: true,
    maxAuxiliaryImageSize: 300,
    visualizerVersion: 1
)
let verifier = FaceLivenessVerifier(language: .Czech, settings: settings)
```

Update method

```Swift
let verifier = FaceLivenessVerifier(...)
...
let settings = FaceLivenessVerifierSettings(
    isLegacyModeEnabled: false,
    maxAuxiliaryImageSize: 300,
    visualizerVersion: 1
)
verifier.update(settings: settings)
let info = verifier.getAuxiliaryInfo()
```

### Result

The returning value of the `verify()` or `verifyImage(imageBuffer: )` methods is a struct of type `DocumentResult` for documents, `HologramResult` for holograms or `FaceResult` for face liveness.

It contains all the information found describing currently analysed document/face.

`DocumentResult` contains following values:

- `state` - state of currently analysed image (e.g. `NoMatchFound`, `Blurry` or `ReflectionPresent` etc.)
- `code` - version of a document (e.g. new or old version of Slovakia identity card). This attribute can be `nil` when state is equal to `NoMatchFound`
- `role` - specified type of a document
- `country` - specified origin country of a document
- `page` - specified page
- `signature` - signature when state is OK

Hologram result contains state of currently analysed image.
`HologramResult.state`  can be `center`, `tiltLeftAndRight`, `tiltUpAndDown` and finally  `ok`

Selfie detection result contains state of currently analysed image.
`SelfieResult.state` can be `NoFaceFound`, `Blurry`, `Dark`, `ConfirmingFace` and finally `Ok`

Face liveness detection result contains state of currently analysed image.
`FaceLivenessResult.state` can be `LookAtMe`, `TurnHead`, `Smile`, `Blurry`, `Dark` and finally  `Ok`

### Signature

The SDK now generates a signature for the snapshots it takes. The backend uses the signature to verify picture origin and integrity. The signature lets you upload the final frame instead of the whole video for verification. The SDK only generates a signature when the result state is OK. 

The SDK provides the signature as an attribute inside of the result objects of verifiers, such as `DocumentResult`, `FaceLivenessResult`, and `SelfieResult`. Hologram does not support the signature. 

This is what `ImageSignature` structure looks like:

```swift
struct ImageSignature {
    let image: Data
    let signature: String
}
```

Where the `image` attribute is binary data of the image that contains the SDK signature. You have to send this binary data to the backend if you want to have your signature to be validated. The `signature` attribute is a string that represents the signature itself that you should send to the backend in your investigation sample HTTP REST call. 

Signature now contain "--ZENID_SIGNATURE--" prefix. The new recommended way of sending signature is by adding it as a second file to multipart upload of sample (first file being the image or video itself). Alternative method, if you are uploading image/file as binary body in POST request is to append signature to binary data of image/video as is. Old way of sending signature as request parameter in URL still works, but you can encounter issues due to URL size limits so it is recommended to switch to the new method.

**Sample request** - Signature added to the end of the body of the message

```swift
func sendImageWithSignature(imageData: Data, signature: String) {
    let urlString = "https://your-server/sample?country=&expectedSampleType=DocumentPicture&documentCode=&pageCode=&role=&profile="
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else { return }

    var httpBodyData = imageData

    // Append the signature data to the imageData
    if let signatureData = signature.data(using: .utf8) {
        httpBodyData.append(signatureData)
    }

    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("application/octet-stream", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
    request.setValue("\(httpBodyData.count)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Length")
    request.httpBody = httpBodyData

    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
        if let error = error { return }
        if let data = data { return }
    }
    task.resume()
}
```

#### How to fix focusing problem with new iPhone Pro models.

You must zoom in on the video stream to compensate for the minimum focus distance and required magnification. 
We created a method which do exactly this, so you don't have to write your own. This method is available since
iOS 15 which covers iPhone 13 Pro and newer.

```swift
if #available(iOS 15.0, *) {
    Camera.setRecommendedZoomFactor(for: device) // AVCaptureDevice
}
```
